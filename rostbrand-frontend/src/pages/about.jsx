    <p>In my work I focus on the different appearances of decay and the associations surrounding it. I am looking for the ideal form of incompleteness as well as completeness within decay. The imagery of comics is timeless and universal therefore it provides me with a great range of freedom. By now I have a different perspective on comics. They present me with the ideal raw material for dealing with topics like fear, confusion, loss of identity and hero cults. In my work the world of the superheroes is upside down, balancing between chaos and order. </p>
